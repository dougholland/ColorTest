# Color Test
When persisting a color from a MapFeature in SwiftData, the color stored renders differently in dark appearance than in light appearance. This Xcode project shows that the Colors are all the same when they originate from the SwiftUI ColorPicker, in light and dark appearance, but are not the same when the original color is from the selected MapFeature. In that case, there is a difference in color that appears to be because the dark mode variation of the color is not applied.
